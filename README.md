# Phxgpu

This project uses WebGPU to render a triangle within a canvas element on a [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org) LiveView page.

With the support for Machine Learning with the [Elixir Axon](https://github.com/elixir-nx/axon), I think interesting applications are possible by combining a capable web framework like Phoenix Live with client-side rendering with WebGPU. For example, it can be used to visualize simulation data streamed from a Phoenix backend, visualize network performance during training, etc.

## Building and Running

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:9000) from your browser.
